The subject of this project is Optimization of AI Integration in Web Applications.
The description goes as follows, The market for AI solutions is growing enormously. However, these solutions are not directly usable for end-users. Often, these solutions need to be integrated within web applications. Currently, this type of integration is not straightforward. Nevertheless, there are increasingly more integration solutions available. In this bachelor thesis, we investigated the different groups of AI solutions and which integration techniques we can employ to make them usable within web applications. Terms such as Langchain, Llama index, Tensorflow, Vector databases, WebAssembly, and several others are relevant in this context. With the results of this research, architects and developers should be able to integrate AI solutions into existing and new web applications more quickly. The researcher will map and examine multiple integration possibilities. Subsequently, a practical approach will be taken to test one of these techniques, developing a web application that utilizes the chosen integration method. For the selection of different forms of artificial intelligence, the researcher will choose the most common AI. The results indicate that the various integration techniques investigated can indeed be implemented in web applications for end-user use. Based on these findings, we can conclude that developers, using these techniques, can implement artificial intelligence solutions in their applications themselves. Although this research utilizes various techniques, it is important to mention that there are alternatives available that may better suit the type of application being developed.
The goal of this project is to determine whether AI can be integrated into web applications.
